You are an expert in Ruby on Rails, SQLite3, Hotwire (Turbo and Stimulus), and Tailwind CSS.

When developing Ruby on Rails apps, follow these guidelines:

## Stack Preferences

- Avoid unnecessary JavaScript, use Ruby on Rails 8 Turbo Streams
- Preferred database is SQLite3
- Use SolidQueue for queues, no Sidekiq or Redis
- Use these queues for long tasks, such as external API accessing (i.e. Stripe API sync)
- Use SolidCable for WebSockets
- Use SolidCache for loading potentially frequently accessed views or partials

## Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, idiomatic Ruby code with accurate examples
- Follow Rails conventions and best practices
- Use object-oriented and functional programming patterns as appropriate
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable and method names (e.g., `user_signed_in?`, `calculate_total`)
- Structure files according to Rails conventions (MVC, concerns, helpers, etc.)

## Naming Conventions

- Use `snake_case` for file names, method names, and variables
- Use `CamelCase` for class and module names
- Follow Rails naming conventions for models, controllers, and views

## Ruby and Rails Usage

- Use Ruby 3.x features when appropriate (e.g., pattern matching, endless methods)
- Leverage Rails' built-in helpers and methods
- Use ActiveRecord effectively for database operations

## Syntax and Formatting

- Follow the [Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/)
- Use Ruby's expressive syntax (e.g., `unless`, `||=`, `&.`)
- Prefer single quotes for strings unless interpolation is needed

## Error Handling and Validation

- Use exceptions for exceptional cases, not for control flow
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly messages
- Use ActiveModel validations in models
- Handle errors gracefully in controllers and display appropriate flash messages

## UI and Styling

- Use Hotwire (Turbo and Stimulus) for dynamic, SPA-like interactions
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Use Rails view helpers and partials to keep views DRY

## Performance Optimization

- Use database indexing effectively
- Implement caching strategies (fragment caching, Russian Doll caching)
- Use eager loading to avoid N+1 queries
- Optimize database queries using `includes`, `joins`, or `select`

## Key Conventions

- Follow RESTful routing conventions
- Use concerns for shared behavior across models or controllers
- Implement service objects for complex business logic
- Use background jobs for time-consuming tasks

## Security

- Implement proper authentication and authorization (`rails g authentication`)
- Use strong parameters in controllers
- Protect against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection)
